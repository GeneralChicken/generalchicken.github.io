title: Choosing Between Ubuntu Flavors

## Ubuntu Flavors

Ubuntu flavors are Linux distributions based off of the popular Ubuntu.  However, they share all of the basic packages, except for the desktop environment (DE).  There are currently 7 different flavors, namely [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/ "Kubuntu website"), [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/ "Lubuntu website"), [Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/ "Ubuntu Budgie website"), [Ubuntu Kylin](http://www.ubuntukylin.com/index.php?lang=en "Ubuntu Kylin website"), [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/ "Ubuntu MATE website"), [Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org/ "Ubuntu Studio website"), and [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/ "Xubuntu website").  Each one of them has its own perks, so this guide is to help you select the one that suits you.

### RAM

Usually the limiting factor is RAM or the CPU.  If the CPU is too old (single core), consider upgrading - even the most lightweight Ubuntu flavors don't run very well on one core.  If you don't have much RAM, it's advisable to make a swap partition.

| Flavor        | RAM Usage |
|---------------|-----------|
| Kubuntu       |   ~910 MB |
| Ubuntu        |   ~760 MB |
| Ubuntu Budgie |   ~563 MB |
| Ubuntu Mate   |   ~447 MB |
| Xubuntu       |   ~394 MB |
| Lubuntu       |   ~289 MB |
| Ubuntu Kylin  |       N/A |
| Ubuntu Studio |       N/A |

These tests were run with Wi-Fi on and with 8 GB of RAM on a live session.  The amount of RAM Linux uses scales with the total available RAM, so results may vary.  Ubuntu Kylin was unable to boot, and Ubuntu Studio was too large for my 1.9 GB flash drive, so those values are not included.

### Hard Drive Space

Due to my method of testing, I was quite unable to measure the amount of disk space it took up.  However, thanks to Reddit user [Shaikat52](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shaikat52 "Shaikat52's user page")
