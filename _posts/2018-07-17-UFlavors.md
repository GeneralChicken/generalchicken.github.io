## Ubuntu Flavors

Ubuntu flavors are Linux distributions based off of the popular Ubuntu.  However, they share all of the basic packages, except for the desktop environment (DE).  There are currently 7 different flavors, namely [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/ "Kubuntu website"), [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me/ "Lubuntu website"), [Ubuntu Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/ "Ubuntu Budgie website"), [Ubuntu Kylin](http://www.ubuntukylin.com/index.php?lang=en "Ubuntu Kylin website"), [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/ "Ubuntu MATE website"), [Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org/ "Ubuntu Studio website"), and [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/ "Xubuntu website").
