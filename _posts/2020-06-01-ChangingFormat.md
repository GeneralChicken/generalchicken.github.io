title: Changing the format of my blog
---

Let me say that I've really enjoyed writing these how-to blog posts.  However, most of this information is easily found online using a search engine, which means I'm not adding any value by making these posts.  The one thing that the internet doesn't have is my opinions on new tech issues and programming styles, so expect to see some new posts about those soon!

I will be updating the blog once a month.
