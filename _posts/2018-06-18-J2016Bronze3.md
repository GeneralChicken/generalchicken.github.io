# Mowing the Field

[Link to problem statement](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=593, "Jan. 2016 USACO, Problem 3 of Bronze")

## Analysis

FJ's field can be thought of as an extremely large 2-D array, with -1 representing points that FJ has not visited yet.  Because arrays do not support negative indicies, FJ starts at (1000, 1000) in the array.  FJ starts mowing the field at time 0.  For each step he takes, we find the difference in the time in the array and the current time, if the time in the array is not -1.  We then put the current time in the array, and repeat for every step in FJ's path.
